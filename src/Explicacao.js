          <h2>3. How the Evaluation Calculation Works</h2>
          <p>
            The final score of a framework is calculated based on the evaluations of criteria and subcriteria, taking into account the weights assigned to each. The calculation methodology is designed to reflect the relative importance of each criterion and subcriterion in the context of cyber risk management.
          </p>

          <h3>Subcriteria Score Calculation</h3>
          <p>
            Each subcriterion within a criterion receives a score and a weight indicating its priority. The weight scale works as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>High Priority:</strong> Weight = 3</li>
            <li><strong>Medium Priority:</strong> Weight = 2</li>
            <li><strong>Low Priority:</strong> Weight = 1</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The weighted score of each subcriterion is calculated by multiplying the assigned score by its weight. For example, if a subcriterion "Data Protection" has a score of 5 and a weight of "High Priority", the weighted score will be:
          </p>
          <blockquote>Weighted Score = Score (5) x Weight (3) = 15</blockquote>

          <h3>Criteria Score Calculation</h3>
          <p>
            The score of each criterion is obtained by the weighted average of its subcriteria scores. If a criterion has several subcriteria, their scores are summed based on weight, and the average is calculated. For example, if the criterion "Cost" includes three subcriteria with the following weighted scores:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>License: Score = 4, Weight = 2 (Medium Priority)</li>
            <li>Maintenance: Score = 3, Weight = 3 (High Priority)</li>
            <li>Consultancy: Score = 2, Weight = 1 (Low Priority)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The final score for the "Cost" criterion would be:
          </p>
          <blockquote>Final Criterion Score = (4 x 2 + 3 x 3 + 2 x 1) ÷ (2 + 3 + 1) = 3.33</blockquote>

          <h3>Final Framework Score Calculation</h3>
          <p>
            The final score of a framework is obtained by the weighted average of the criteria scores. Just like the subcriteria, each criterion has a weight that reflects its overall importance in the framework evaluation. These weights are adjustable, but by default, all criteria have the same weight.
          </p>
          <blockquote>Final Score = (Criterion 1 Score x Weight 1 + Criterion 2 Score x Weight 2 + ...) ÷ (Sum of Weights)</blockquote>

          <h3>Result Interpretation</h3>
          <p>
            The final scores are used to compare frameworks in terms of suitability for a particular organization or cyber risk management scenario. The higher the score, the better the framework meets the evaluated criteria and subcriteria. This weighted approach ensures that frameworks are fairly evaluated, considering the priorities set by the evaluator.
